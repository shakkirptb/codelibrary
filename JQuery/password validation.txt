I guess your regular expression should look like:

(/^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])[0-9a-zA-Z]{8,}$/)
Here is an explanation:

(/^
(?=.*\d)                //should contain at least one digit
(?=.*[a-z])             //should contain at least one lower case
(?=.*[A-Z])             //should contain at least one upper case
[a-zA-Z0-9]{8,}         //should contain at least 8 from the mentioned characters
$/)


If you need one single regex, try:

^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*(_|[^\w])).+$
A short explanation:

^                  // the start of the string
(?=.*[a-z])        // use positive look ahead to see if at least one lower case letter exists
(?=.*[A-Z])        // use positive look ahead to see if at least one upper case letter exists
(?=.*\d)           // use positive look ahead to see if at least one digit exists
(?=.*[_\W])        // use positive look ahead to see if at least one underscore or non-word character exists
.+                 // gobble up the entire string
$                  // the end of the string
